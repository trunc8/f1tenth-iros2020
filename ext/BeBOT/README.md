# BeBOT
Bernstein/Bezi√©r Optimal Trajectories (BeBOT) toolkit for generating optimal trajectories for single or multiple autonomous vehicles.

A comprehensive review of the techniques employed by the toolkit can be found in [BeBOT: Bernstein Polynomial Toolkit for Trajectory Generation](https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967564).

# Running Examples
An Anaconda environment YAML file is provided to help make the process of running the examples smooth. On Linux you should be able to run `conda env create -f bebotenv.yml`. On Windows, you will need to use the Anaconda Navigator to import the environment file.
